# UnSavedChanges

In the real world, the user may enter some data and navigate away knowingly or unknowingly. There will be a risk of losing user's changes. It's better to give a chance to the user to decide whether to stay or continue to navigate away from the current screen. This kind of scenario can be handled using Deactivate Guard. 

This demo shows how to handle unsaved changes using 'can deactivate' Guard.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
